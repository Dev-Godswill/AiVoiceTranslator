## <a name="detailed-breakdown"></a> Detailed Breakdown of the Code
The purpose of this Python script is to create an application that translates spoken English into six popular languages (Spanish, Turkish, Japanese, French, German, and Chinese) and plays back the translated text as speech. The program uses Gradio for creating the user interface, AssemblyAI for speech-to-text transcription, and ElevenLabs for text-to-speech generation.

**Skills Acquired:**
1. API integration (AssemblyAI, ElevenLabs)
2. File handling and text processing
3. Real-time user interface creation using Gradio
4. Error handling and exception management
5. Text translation via the translate library

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the major segments in the code:

**Features:**
1. **Real-time Date/Time:** The dashboard displays the current date and time, ensuring that the information is always up to date. 
2. **Employee Search:** The dashboard includes a search bar where users can search for an employee using their Employee ID. If an Employee ID that doesn't exist is entered, an error message ("Employee ID not found, retry") is displayed. Although the dataset primarily contains Employee IDs, the same search functionality can extended for users to search for an employee by their name.

## How to Use
1. Download the Excel file from this repository. 
2. Open the Excel file using Microsoft Excel. 
3. Ensure that macros are enabled to fully utilize the dashboard's features. 
4. Navigate to the dashboard worksheet. 
5. Use the search bar to find an employee by entering their Employee ID or name. 
6. Explore the various visualizations and insights provided on the dashboard. 
7. Enjoy using the HR Analytics Dashboard!
